% Common protocol themes: YANG, YANG-Push, NMDA, NETCONF, RESTCONF, CORECONF, SZTP, Call-Home, YANG-Library

% Current IETF network management topics:
% NETCONF (NETwork CONFiguration) WG
% NETCONF-next, RESTCONF-next, configuration of clients and servers, list pagination, transaction correlation, YANG-push transports (Protocols and YANG models)

% NETMOD (NETwork MODelling) WG
% YANG-next, YANG versioning, system configuration, data immutability (Language and YANG models)
% NMOP (Network Management Operations) WG
% YANG-push integration with Apache Kafka & time series databases, anomaly detection and incident management, digital map modelling

% Network Inventory (IVY) WG
% Hardware & software components, physical location, etc. correlating with existing IETF models (topolopy, service attachment points)

% Discussion topics will include, but are not limited to:
% 	•	Tooling, open source, experimentation, proof of concept, multi-vendor interoperability test (e.g., EANTC), and system integration
% 	•	Data consistency to support richer observability (Data & Knowledge)
% 	•	Integration issues with the business layer
% 	•	Automation, orchestration, and autonomy
% Goal is to Explore new requirements for future network management operations in a collaborative manner with the industry, network operators, and protocol engineers

\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}

The IAB workshop on the Next Era of Network Management Operations (NEMOPS) aims to foster dialogue between network operators and protocol developers, guiding the IETF in evolving network management protocols. This initiative seeks to evaluate past achievements and outline future requirements for network management operations.

In this paper we introduce a cloud-native transport automation software solution designed to machine learning and open standards for advanced analytics and automation across microwave, IP, and optical fronthaul networks. The goal being to facilitate communication service providers the automation of their network operations, optimizing network performance, reducing costs, and enhancing end-user experiences.


\section{ETAC Overview?} \label{overview}

Depending on how deep we can get on what we can say at IETF, we may scope the paper accordingly

\textbf{Participating Entities}

% high level
We define three primary entities

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{one}: Typically a ...

\section{Protocol Insights} \label{insights}

% Network Automation
% Network Analytics/Visibility
% Maybe ML?
% RESTCONF/CORECONF (compression YANG/CBOR)

\textbf{Current IETF protocols used}

We use protocols such as NMDA \cite{rfc8342}, NETCONF \cite{rfc6241}, and SNMP \cite{rfc3411} to ...


% Perhaps mention ETAC and keep it light and only present what needs to be presented.
Our solution is built upon...


\section{Protocol Evolution} \label{insights}

% Maybe GenAI and Intents?
% More standard interfaces?
% More closed-loop Automation
% Workflow Programmability and Network APIs (Ericsson message)
